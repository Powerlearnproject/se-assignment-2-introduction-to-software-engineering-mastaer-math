Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Concept of Modularity in Software Design
Modularity is a design principle that involves dividing a software system into separate, interchangeable components, known as modules, each encapsulating a specific part of the system’s functionality. These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained independently of each other, but they work together to form a complete system.

Key Characteristics of Modularity
Encapsulation: Each module contains all the necessary components (data and functions) to perform its function independently.
Separation of Concerns: Different functionalities are separated into distinct modules, each addressing a specific aspect of the system.
Interchangeability: Modules can be replaced or updated with minimal impact on the rest of the system.
Reusability: Modules can be reused across different parts of the system or even in different projects.
Interfaces: Modules interact with each other through well-defined interfaces, promoting loose coupling.
Benefits of Modularity
Maintainability
Isolation of Changes: Changes in one module are less likely to impact others, making it easier to update and maintain the system.
